### pneumonia-detection

Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children under 5, responsible for ~740,000 deaths annually (WHO, 2019). Early detection via chest X-rays significantly improves survival rates, but many hospitals lack immediate radiology expertise, leading to delayed diagnosis.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered web application that assists medical professionals in automatically detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays, reducing diagnosis time and improving patient outcomes.
