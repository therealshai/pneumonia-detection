Indicator,Relevance,Justification
Chest X-ray infiltrate,5,Radiographic evidence of new infiltrates is the clinical gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis.
Procalcitonin & CRP,5,High diagnostic accuracy  when combined with symptoms; distinguish bacterial vs viral infections.
Severity scores ,5,"Predict hospitalization need and mortality; CURBâ€‘65 includes RR, BP, urea, age, confusion."
"Clinical symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, sputum)",4,Improve diagnostic confidence when clustered; not specific alone but highly useful in triage.
WBC count ,4,Helps differentiate bacterial pneumonia and assess immune response; part of CURB?65 and ATS criteria.
Oxygenation ,4,Key in assessing respiratory failure risk; threshold indicates severe pneumonia.
"Other labs (platelets, urea, albumin)",3,Used in scoring systems  help refine risk levels.
"Radiomics features (lesion shape, heterogeneity)",3,"Emerging use in severity classification using AI, especially for SCAP."
Pathogen-specific antigens (urine/serum),2,"Specific to certain pathogens (e.g., S. pneumoniae); limited general use but helpful in ICU."
"Emerging biomarkers (IL-6, copeptin, lactate)",2,"Prognostic rather than diagnostic; elevated in critical cases, used for outcome prediction."
